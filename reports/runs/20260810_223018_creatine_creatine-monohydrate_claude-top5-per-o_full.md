Ingredient: `creatine` · Form: `creatine_monohydrate` · Mode: **claude-top5-per_o**

Auto-written with the summary after every extraction.

## How the score is built

Deterministic (`pipeline/scoring.py`). Models extract fields only.

```text
1. weight w = design × RoB × size × funding × OA        (study QUALITY only)
   form / dose / population are NOT in the weight — they are arcs
2. E = Σw ; E' adds a capped synthesis lift (ceiling 1.30)
3. d = Σ(w·s)/Σw      direction, −1…+1
   H = weighted var(s)/1.5
   c = 1 − e^(−E'/k)  confidence, k = 3
4. signed  = clamp(round(100 × d × c × (1 − 0.4 × H)), −100, +100)   [internal]
5. FOUR ARCS, each carrying a verdict AND its coverage:
     effect    d over ALL evidence
     form      d over trials using YOUR form      + share of evidence
     dose      d over trials in YOUR dose band    + share of evidence
     evidence  c (pure quantity, no direction)
6. composite = 100 × c × mean(effect, form, dose)   [the 0–100 shown]
   a MISSING subset is penalised at its transfer tier, never dropped
7. Gate if almost no human clinical weight → no number at all
```

4-arc donut — every arc carries a VERDICT and the COVERAGE behind it:
- **effect** — what all the evidence says
- **form** — what trials using *your* form found, and how many there were
- **dose** — what trials in *your* dose band found, and how many
- **evidence** — how much trustworthy evidence exists at all (c)

Centre = the 0–100 composite. A low number with a full evidence arc means
"does not work"; a low number with an empty one means "barely studied".

SRs (`--with-sr`) only raise confidence E′, never invent patients.

## Selftest: **PASS**

```text
  PASS  real journal not flagged: Acta oto-laryngologica  list entry 'lar'
  PASS  real journal not flagged: The Journal of Clinical Investigation  list entry 'e journal'
  PASS  MIN_PUBLISHER_CHARS=6 excludes every sub-6 acronym  'LAR' is why the floor exists
  PASS  flag counts the studies, not the venues  1
  PASS  publisher coverage is reported beside the verdict  0 flagged @ 0 resolved != 0 flagged @ 240 resolved
  PASS  a publisher hit is never reported as a journal  naming an imprint as a journal is the libel-shaped error
  PASS  'not checked' is distinguishable from 'clean' in the summary  the truncated-list bug read as a clean corpus for four commits
  PASS  real journal in a publisher field is not flagged: The Journal of Rheumatology  matched list entry 'e-journal' before anchoring — the libel-shaped error
  PASS  generic list fragment does not flag an unrelated imprint  matched 'Science Publishers'; would hit any publisher with that phrase
  PASS  a genuine list entry still flags with a corporate suffix  anchoring must not cost true positives
  PASS  name drift is under-flagged, not force-matched  measured live 2026-08-09 on doi 10.4172/2157-7633.1000345
  PASS  a resolved-publisher run with no hits reads as a real answer  0 flagged @ 2 resolved is data, not a gap

STRUCTURAL INVARIANTS
  PASS  the real deterministic layer reaches no model boundary  
  PASS  no allowlist entry is stale or reasonless  
  PASS  every AGENTS entry has a schema, a prompt and a known tier  
  PASS  no formatting trick hides a model import  8 evasions all caught
  PASS  innocent source does not trip the check  false positives: []
  PASS  a reasonless allowlist entry is itself a failure  an unexplained exception is an undocumented hole in invariant 1
  PASS  the deterministic layer imports on a bare interpreter  
  PASS  a module-level third-party import is caught  
  PASS  the same import inside a function is fine  lazy is the fix, so it must not be reported as the problem
  PASS  stdlib and local imports are not third-party  

ANCHOR BAND FEASIBILITY
  PASS  ceiling_score reproduces score_ecu's own arithmetic  checked at 0/5/10/25/50% null mass
  PASS  H rises with disagreement rather than being a free parameter  a unanimous corpus has no spread; varying H independently of the null share overstates every reachable score
  PASS  the five confidence-A anchor floors still imply their measured null tolerances  6.4-11.1% null mass; see docs/REVIEW_PENDING.md

RELEVANCE: BIOMARKER IS NOT THE SUPPLEMENT
  PASS  kinase-only paper is rejected  
  PASS  a real creatine trial that measures CK still passes  bare mentions > marker mentions -> supplement is present
  PASS  phosphokinase counts as the marker too  
  PASS  a topical cream is not evidence about oral supplementation  
  PASS  mentioning topical delivery in the abstract does not reject  
  PASS  other ingredients are untouched by the marker rule  
  PASS  no anchor floor is unreachable at zero nulls  a floor above +100 would be a typo, not a calibration question

ALL PASSED

- Model calls: **9** (cache hits 848, failures 8)
- Input tokens: **1,265,568** (fresh 12 · cache-write 0 · cache-read 1,265,556)
- Output tokens: **3,839**
- **Spent on this run: $0.00** — subscription, not metered.
- **API-equivalent cost: $0.441** — what the same work would cost billed per token.
- Per study: **0.1 calls**, **$0.0031** API-equivalent across 144 scored studies.

Tier → model is pinned in `claude_adapter.TIER_MODEL` (full ids, never aliases: an alias floats to a new model while the cache key does not change). Tier A = classification, B = extraction, C = the highest-risk agent.

## Per-agent success rates (this run)

| Agent | Studies OK | Studies failed | Cache | Retries | Why it failed |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| S3 | 142 | 2 | 141 | 0 | exit 1: max_turns (x1); exit 1: Prompt is too long (x1) |

_One row per STUDY. The cost table above counts CLI ATTEMPTS, so its totals are higher by exactly the retries column._

**Telemetry does not reconcile — do not quote these rates:**
- S6B: 0 attempts in the cost table but no row in the success table -- its failures are invisible to anyone reading success rates
- S3: 9 attempts for 144 studies -- impossible, every study needs at least one attempt
- S4: 0 attempts for 144 studies -- impossible, every study needs at least one attempt
- S5: 0 attempts for 144 studies -- impossible, every study needs at least one attempt
- S7: 0 attempts for 144 studies -- impossible, every study needs at least one attempt

## ECU scores — this run only

| Outcome | 0–100 | Verdict | effect | in your form | at your dose | evidence | n |
|---|---:|---|---|---|---|---|---:|

_0–100 = 100 × c × mean(effect, form, dose). Each arc shows its verdict and the share of evidence behind it. A low number with a FULL evidence arc means 'does not work'; with an EMPTY one it means 'barely studied'._

## Notes

- Claude and Grok scores are **never merged**.

- Form does **not** penalize the center score; it is the form arc only.

- Predatory venues: flagged + counted; weight zero is OFF for now.

- Inconclusive + low n is often the confidence ceiling (SPEC 13), not a bug.

- This report is **this run only** — other ingredients are not mixed in.
