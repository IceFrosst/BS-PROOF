# BS-PROOF full audit report (claude-top5-per_o)

Generated: **2026-08-10 00:06 UTC**


scoring_model: v2-four-arc

Ingredient: `creatine` · Form: `creatine_monohydrate` · Mode: **claude-top5-per_o**

Auto-written with the summary after every extraction.

## How the score is built

Deterministic (`pipeline/scoring.py`). Models extract fields only.

```text
1. weight w = design × RoB × size × funding × OA        (study QUALITY only)
   form / dose / population are NOT in the weight — they are arcs
2. E = Σw ; E' adds a capped synthesis lift (ceiling 1.30)
3. d = Σ(w·s)/Σw      direction, −1…+1
   H = weighted var(s)/1.5
   c = 1 − e^(−E'/k)  confidence, k = 3
4. signed  = clamp(round(100 × d × c × (1 − 0.4 × H)), −100, +100)   [internal]
5. FOUR ARCS, each carrying a verdict AND its coverage:
     effect    d over ALL evidence
     form      d over trials using YOUR form      + share of evidence
     dose      d over trials in YOUR dose band    + share of evidence
     evidence  c (pure quantity, no direction)
6. composite = 100 × c × mean(effect, form, dose)   [the 0–100 shown]
   a MISSING subset is penalised at its transfer tier, never dropped
7. Gate if almost no human clinical weight → no number at all
```

4-arc donut — every arc carries a VERDICT and the COVERAGE behind it:
- **effect** — what all the evidence says
- **form** — what trials using *your* form found, and how many there were
- **dose** — what trials in *your* dose band found, and how many
- **evidence** — how much trustworthy evidence exists at all (c)

Centre = the 0–100 composite. A low number with a full evidence arc means
"does not work"; a low number with an empty one means "barely studied".

SRs (`--with-sr`) only raise confidence E′, never invent patients.

## Selftest: **PASS**

```text
INGREDIENT -> SEARCH TERM
  PASS  underscore becomes a space  
  PASS  multi-underscore ids work  
  PASS  single-word ids are unchanged  why creatine/magnesium runs never exposed this
  PASS  relevance gate matches a snake_case id against real prose  dropped 175/175 vitamin D RCTs before this
  PASS  relevance gate still rejects the wrong ingredient  the fix must not make the gate permissive
  PASS  no underscore survives into a query  TITLE:"vitamin_d" matched ~nothing; PUB_TYPE is a field name, not a term
  PASS  per-outcome queries are fixed too  outcome_query had its own copy of the bug

STORE CONCURRENCY
  PASS  WAL is on (one writer + many readers)  
  PASS  busy_timeout makes a competing writer wait, not raise  
  PASS  3 concurrent writers all commit  []
  PASS  no writer silently lost its rows  180 = 3 x 60, the parallel-run case

PREDATORY VENUE (publisher, not journal title)
  PASS  crossref.venue reads publisher, journal and ISSNs apart  
  PASS  crossref.venue on a missing record stays null, never guesses  
  predatory list: 1162 journal titles loaded
  PASS  known predatory publisher is flagged  
  PASS  publisher containment tolerates a legal suffix  imprints appear as 'X Ltd' / 'X BV' in Crossref
  PASS  legitimate publisher stays clean: Elsevier BV  
  PASS  legitimate publisher stays clean: Springer Nature  
  PASS  legitimate publisher stays clean: MDPI AG  
  PASS  legitimate publisher stays clean: Wolters Kluwer Health  
  PASS  real journal not flagged: American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecolog  list entry 'american journal'
  PASS  real journal not flagged: Acta oto-laryngologica  list entry 'lar'
  PASS  real journal not flagged: The Journal of Clinical Investigation  list entry 'e journal'
  PASS  MIN_PUBLISHER_CHARS=6 excludes every sub-6 acronym  'LAR' is why the floor exists
  PASS  flag counts the studies, not the venues  1
  PASS  publisher coverage is reported beside the verdict  0 flagged @ 0 resolved != 0 flagged @ 240 resolved
  PASS  a publisher hit is never reported as a journal  naming an imprint as a journal is the libel-shaped error
  PASS  'not checked' is distinguishable from 'clean' in the summary  the truncated-list bug read as a clean corpus for four commits
  PASS  real journal in a publisher field is not flagged: The Journal of Rheumatology  matched list entry 'e-journal' before anchoring — the libel-shaped error
  PASS  generic list fragment does not flag an unrelated imprint  matched 'Science Publishers'; would hit any publisher with that phrase
  PASS  a genuine list entry still flags with a corporate suffix  anchoring must not cost true positives
  PASS  name drift is under-flagged, not force-matched  measured live 2026-08-09 on doi 10.4172/2157-7633.1000345
  PASS  a resolved-publisher run with no hits reads as a real answer  0 flagged @ 2 resolved is data, not a gap

ALL PASSED

Tier → model is pinned in `claude_adapter.TIER_MODEL` (full ids, never aliases: an alias floats to a new model while the cache key does not change). Tier A = classification, B = extraction, C = the highest-risk agent.

## ECU scores — this run only

| Outcome | 0–100 | Verdict | effect | in your form | at your dose | evidence | n |
|---|---:|---|---|---|---|---|---:|

_0–100 = 100 × c × mean(effect, form, dose). Each arc shows its verdict and the share of evidence behind it. A low number with a FULL evidence arc means 'does not work'; with an EMPTY one it means 'barely studied'._

## Notes

- Claude and Grok scores are **never merged**.

- Form does **not** penalize the center score; it is the form arc only.

- Predatory venues: flagged + counted; weight zero is OFF for now.

- Inconclusive + low n is often the confidence ceiling (SPEC 13), not a bug.

- This report is **this run only** — other ingredients are not mixed in.
